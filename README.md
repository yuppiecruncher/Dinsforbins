# Dinsforbins
Simple Dinner Reservation Web Application Based on Python3

The goal of this project is to deploy a live web application with some key features.

This web application will allow a user (diner) to reserve menu options and times from a list populated by a content producer (the chef). A third user (the analyst) will be able to see usage statistics, survey responses and other relevant data through a built-in dashboard.

The webapp is built upon the following stack:

Pyramid Framework
<p>  -utilizing Chameleon template
<p>Twitter Bootstrap
<p>SQLAlchemy (and Alembic)
<p>Postgresql
<p>Twilio

Planned functionality:
-Account management and role assignment (diner, chef, analyst)
-Basic HTML error correction
-Cookie sessions
-Email confirmation, notifications and surveys


Personal note: this app is being created for my partner. Its namesake comes from their nickname - Bins. Hence "Dinner for Partner" or "Dinsforbins")
